The features of the application are as follows:

1. Input field for the user to input the date, category, description of the category and then the amount of the expense.

2. A table is rendered upon the completion of filling out the form

3. There is delete button that works for each expense should in case you want to want to delete an expense.

4.Do not panic as everything you've selected before won't delete upon refreshing or quiting your browser as everything is being stored inside a localStorage.

                             NEW UPDATE TO BE ADDED
1. The expense tracker is just like the debit account already. Lets try adding a new input field where the user inputs the amount he wants to spend. Lets call this field "Balance"
2. Then as he add expense, the money should be gradually deducted from the Balance till everything is used up. 
3. If the Balance turns "0", the user should not be able to add expense again.
